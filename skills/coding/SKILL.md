## Coding Guidelines

- Write clear, readable javascript or typescript code with descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch blocks
- Use TypeScript for type safety when working with JavaScript projects
- Write tests alongside implementation code
- Follow existing project conventions and patterns
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Document complex logic with inline comments
